 Description
*Calculator is a device that includes standard, scientific, programmer, and date calculation modes. Scientific mode is typically used for more complex math functions like trignometry, exponents, and logarithms which makes it easy to use day by day for daily math related problems.

2.Requirements
*Visual Studio Code, gcc compiler, Linux OS, Windows OS

 Features
*You can get answer of the problem based on the operation you used.
*Multiple operations can be selected.
*Read the data based on the operation we select.
